# What can the Deluge do?

The Synthstrom Deluge from [Synthstrom Audible](https://synthstrom.com/) is a compact, all-in-one music workstation with a synthesizer, sampler, and sequencer in a single, portable device. It’s designed to let musicians sketch out ideas, build up tracks, and perform without relying on a computer. The grid layout makes it easy to explore melodies, rhythms, and patterns. The Deluge is straightforward to use at a basic level, but incredibly deep and flexible, making it a favourite for both beginner and experienced musicians. With a built-in rechargeable battery, the Deluge is a powerful portable studio.

The Deluge includes an onboard subtractive and FM synthesizer as well as a a sampler, so you can either create sounds from scratch or sample and manipulate audio. You can layer parts and experiment with textures ranging from punchy drums to atmospheric pads.

Its sequencer is flexible, letting you manage unlimited tracks and complex arrangements for the internal synth engine or external gear. You can experiment with Euclidian sequences, conditional note triggers, polyrhythms, and unusual time signatures. The Deluge lets you launch patterns groups, mute sections, and adjust parameters on the fly, so it’s great for live performances.

The optional community-driven firmware dramatically expands the Deluge’s capabilities with additional synthesis modes, powerful new views and control schemes. Whether you’re focused on recording, sound design, or performance, the Deluge provides a unique approach to music-making that can grow with you over time.
