# Note

The name of an event that can be programmed in an instrument clip row in order to generate audio (for example, a synthesized sound or sample) or non-audio (for example, MIDI, CV, Gate) output. Each note has specific parameters that determine when and how a note is to be triggered.

## Settings

Several basic parameters of notes can be changed in settings. These include: quantization.

## Changing the default recording quantization

Quantization sets the accuracy and resolution of how close to the grid intervals notes are placed.

1. Open the settings menu by pressing [SHIFT] + press (SELECT).

1. Turn the (SELECT) control to navigate the menu to select RECORDING

1. Press (SELECT) to drill down the recording menu.

1. Turn the (SELECT) control to navigate the menu and select QUANTIZATION in focus.

1. Press (SELECT) to drill to the quantization settings.

1. Turn (SELECT) to choose between off (384th), 4 bar, 2 bar, 1 bar, 2nd, 4th, 8th, 16th, 32nd and 64th note intervals. A value of 32nd is the default setting.

    - quantization goes even smaller 64th, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, and further but just says Tiny on the menu screen at very small values

1. Press [BACK / UNDO] to back out of the menu when the parameter has been changed or at any time in the menu to back up.

1. The quantization chosen will ensure tight alignment on the grid based on the time interval chosen when recording live.

## Parameters

Several basic parameters of notes can be changed. Some can be changed in settings, others can be changed in the sequencer. Parameters include: position (quantization), length, velocity, probability, iterance, fill, repeat, and length.

### Changing a recorded note velocity

1. After a pattern has been recorded, notes will be at a default velocity level.

1. Press & hold one or more [PAD]’s for the note to change and turn (SCROLL◄►).

1. The system default velocity is 64, however the velocity used on the last note entry / edited will be applied to the next note entered.

1. Velocity will be displayed and its value.

Velocity can also be changed in **Velocity View** and in **Note Editor** (insert links to documentation)

### Setting a note to repeat

1. After a pattern has been recorded, notes will be trigger individually

1. Hold [PAD] + Press & turn (SCROLL▼▲). [PAD] is the note to repeat.

1. The value selected will determine the number of repeats to assign to the selected note, positioned equally in the time interval of the pad.

### Changing the position of recorded note's

#### Nudging individual Note

#### Shift / Rotate Instrument Clip Row

#### Quantizing / Humanizing Instrument Clip Rows

This is a destructive process and the option is set ON by default in the Settings > Community Features.

1. Select [CLIP] view, button lit blue.

1. Hold the [AUDITION] + Turn (TEMPO) clockwise to quantize the selected row or counter clockwise to humanize the selected row.

1. Hold any [AUDITION] Pad + Press & Turn (TEMPO) clockwise to quantize the all rows or counter clockwise to humanize all rows.
