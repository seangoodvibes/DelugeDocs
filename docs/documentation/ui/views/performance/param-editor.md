# Param editor

You can edit the Parameter assigned to each FX column by entering a `PARAM` Editing Mode. 

Here are the instructions for Param Editing mode:

> Enter using `SHIFT` + `KEYBOARD` button. You will need to cycle passed the Value Editing Mode to enter the Param Editing Mode.

or 

> Enter using the menu
> 
> - Enter `PARAM EDITING MODE` by pressing down on the `SELECT` Encoder to open up the Perform FX Menu
> - In the Perform FX menu, select the `EDITING MODE` sub menu and press down on Select Encoder to enter the menu
> - Change Editing Mode to `PARAM`

At any time you can Exit out of `VALUE EDITING MODE` using the `BACK` button

Param Editing Mode:
- Param Editing Mode will show you an overview of the parameters that are assignable to the FX columns in Performance View by lighting dimly the shortcut pads for these parameters.
- Parameters that have been assigned to one or more columns will have their shortcut pads lit up bright white.
- Press on a shortcut pad to illuminate the FX columns that that parameter has been assigned to.
- While holding a shortcut pad, press on the FX columns to assign or unassign a parameter to/from a column.
- Press `HORIZONTAL ENCODER ◀︎▶︎` + `BACK` to clear all existing Parameter assignments.
- When a Parameter has not been assigned to a column, that column will not be lit and will be unusable in Performance View until you assign a Parameter. This applies to editing the values for that FX column as well (assign a Parameter first, then you can edit the values).
- Parameters are saved to PerformanceView.xml. You can manually edit the Parameters in the xml as well, but you must use the exact Parameter names. It is recommended to save a fresh PerformanceView.xml and back it up so you have a record of the Parameter Names.
- Once you are done with editing mode, press `BACK` to exit out to either the `EDITING MODE` sub menu or `PERFORMANCE VIEW` (depending on how you entered the `PARAM EDITING MODE`)
