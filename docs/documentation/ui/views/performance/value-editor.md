# Value editor

You can edit the default values for each pad in the Performance View by entering a `VALUE EDITING MODE`. 

Here are the instructions for Value Editing mode:

> Enter using `SHIFT` + `KEYBOARD` button

or 

> Enter using the menu
> 
> - Enter `VALUE EDITING MODE` by pressing down on the `SELECT` Encoder to open up the Perform FX Menu
> - In the Perform FX menu, select the `EDITING MODE` sub menu and press down on Select Encoder to enter the menu
> - Change Editing Mode to `VALUE` and press down on the `SELECT` Encoder to enter `VALUE EDITING MODE`

At any time you can Exit out of `VALUE EDITING MODE` using the `BACK` button

Value Editing Mode:
- While in the Value Editor, pressing any pad on the grid will display the current value assigned to that pad.
- You can edit that pad's value by turning the select encoder while selecting a single pad (so it's highlighted white) or holding down on that pad. The updated value will be reflected on the display.
- After you have edited a value, the Save button will start flashing to indicate that you have "Unsaved" changes. Press and hold the save button + press the keyboard button to save your changes. Once saved, the Save button will stop blinking. To avoid being distracting, the save button will only blink when you are in editing mode. If you exit editing mode it will stop blinking and if you re-enter editing mode it will blink again to remind you that you have unsaved changes.
- You can re-load saved changes by pressing and holding the Load button + press the keyboard button. This will cause you to lose unsaved changes and the Save button will stop blinking.
- Defaults are saved in an XML file on your SD card called "PerformanceView.XML" - deleting this file will cause the PerformanceView to revert back to its regular default values for each pad.
- Once you are done with editing mode, press `BACK` to exit out to either the `EDITING MODE` sub menu or `PERFORMANCE VIEW` (depending on how you entered the `VALUE EDITING MODE`)
