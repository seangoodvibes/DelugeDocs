# Session Row View

The default session mode presentation is ‘row’ view. This shows a clip per row. A clip for an instrument can be launched individually or within a section along with other different instruments.

Deluge will only play one clip per track at one time in row view. So for example, if two clips use the same synth preset 1 or clone of 1, the clip rows can each be launched but each one will stop playback of the other, allowing only one clip instance of each track to play at one time.
