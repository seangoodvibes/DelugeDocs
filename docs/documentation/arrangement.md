# Arrangement

placeholder to talk about the deluge's arrangement functionality

thought dump: there are two playback modes on the deluge, arranger and song

only one playback mode can be active at a time (e.g. you cannot play the arrangement, switch to song view and trigger a clip in song view to play at the same time as the arrangement)
