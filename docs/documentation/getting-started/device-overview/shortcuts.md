# Shortcuts

Shortcuts are the fastest way to perform actions on the Deluge. 

Examples of actions that can be performed using shortcuts include:

- Clearing notes and automation
- Copy / pasting notes and automation
- Changing sound parameters
- Transposing a clip
- Rotating a clip
- Entering notes with Euclidean sequencing
- Adjusting a note's velocity, probability, iteration and fill settings
- Adjusting the length of an audio clip sample without introducing timestretching
- and many more

This page will provide a listing of the various shortcuts that exist on the Deluge.

In the future, an Actions menu will also be created on the Deluge to execute all of these actions without needing to memorize these shortcuts.
