# Factory library

The Deluge is supplied with a formatted SD card loaded with the factory library. Samples are streamed directly from the SD card when in use, making it an integral part of the device. Ensure the card is inserted in Deluge when in use.

## File structure

Delugeâ€™s SD card contains the presets for kits and synths in XML format which stores the parameter settings and for kits points to the specific samples used.
