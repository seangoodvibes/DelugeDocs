## Power Sources

### USB port

Using the USB port, you can power and charge the Deluge with any USB power source that outputs at least 500mA, such as a computer, USB wall adapter, or powered USB hub. A USB-B to USB-A cable is included.

### DC power socket

Using the DC power socket, you can power and charge the Deluge with any centre-negative 9-12V DC power supply that outputs at least 500mA. This type of power supply isn't included, but you can buy one from a variety of manufacturers and shops.

!!! warning
    The power supply MUST be centre-negative. Using the wrong type of power supply can damage the Deluge.

If the power supply provides enough current, you can connect the Deluge in series with other devices. Internal circuitry minimizes most ground loop noise, but some noise is possible.

If power is connected to the USB port and DC power socket at the same time, the Deluge draws power from the DC power socket.

### Battery

#### Charging the battery

The internal lithium-ion battery charges any time a power source is connected, whether the Deluge is on or off.

The battery status LED shows yellow for charging, green for charged, or red for low-battery.
