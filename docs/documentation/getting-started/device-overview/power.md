## Power Up

Connect the USB cable to Deluge and ensure it is connected to a powered USB device or the 9-12V (centre negative) external supply is connected. The power / USB led will illuminate to indicate power status.

### Powering Up Steps

1. Ensure the device is charged or connected to a USB or external PSU.

1. Ensure the SD card is installed (pins / connectors facing up) using the SD card slot at the front of the unit.

1. Turn the unit on by switching the ON/OFF switch located at the rear of the device to ON.

1. Deluge will power up in ‘clip view’ with a blank song and one blank clip with an assigned synth preset ‘000 Rich Saw Bass’ as shown on the display.

1. Although the sequence can be played, the clips and song are blank at this stage.

1. The synth can be played manually using the right ‘audition / section’ pads where the notes are played chromatically (when SCALE is off) or by default C Major, 7-Note scale. The display will indicate the note as its played.

## Power Sources

### DC Power Socket (9 - 12V)

The Deluge may be powered by any centre-negative 9 - 12V DC power supply which can provide at least 500mA. 

It can be a shared power supply with other units in a typical daisy chained pedal configuration only if the power supply can provide adequate current. The Deluge contains circuitry to minimise ground loop noise in such a setup, although some noise may still be introduced. 

DC and USB power may be connected simultaneously, in which case the Deluge will draw its power from the DC power supply rather than USB. 

It is important to remember that the 9 - 12V DC power supply must be centre-negative, not centre-positive. Using the incorrect power supply may cause damage to the Deluge.

### USB

The Deluge can be powered and charged by its USB type-B connection either from a computer, or from a USB wall adaptor with an appropriate cable. The Deluge may draw up to 500mA from its power source.

### Battery

The Deluge has an internal Li-ion battery, providing 6+ hours of life. The battery charges any time a power source is connected to the USB or DC power socket, regardless of whether the Deluge is switched on. The battery status LED illuminates yellow for charging, green for charge-complete, or red for low-battery.

The Deluge’s battery is an “18650” 3.7V Li-ion, and may be replaced by the user. These batteries are readily available from stores everywhere. A “protected” or “unprotected” type may be used. A battery of any mAh rating may be used - higher mAh ratings simply mean longer battery life.

Please note that your Deluge will be shipped with very little charge in the battery. You will need to plug it into a power source to use it and begin charging the battery.
