## Parts of a song

### Song
: A discrete creative endeavour, such as an arrangement, sketch, 8-bar loop, jam, live recording template, or musical experiment. A song is always associated with at least one song file on the Deluge.

#### Settings
: User configurable settings that dictate how a song should operate - e.g. swing, tempo.

#### Master Parameters
: The name of an adjustable value, such as LPF Frequency, that can be manipulated and saved as part the Song and which adjust the output generated by each song component (e.g. clip).

#### Song file
: A file on the SD card that stores all of the information about a song.

### Track
: A single instrument or layer in a song. Each track is either an audio track or an instrument track. An instrument track is either a kit instrument track or a melodic instrument track (synth, MIDI, CV). Tracks contain one or more clips.

#### Track preset file
: A preset file can be saved for synth, kit and MIDI instrument tracks. A preset file contains track information configured in a clip (such as base parameter values, synth engine settings, kit drum information, samples used), but not all track information. For example, note sequences and parameter automation sequences are not saved in the track preset file (that information is only saved as part of the song file). 

### Clip
: A unique instance of a track that stores information required to generate an output (for example, samples, note sequences, parameter automation sequences, and other track settings). Each clip is either an audio clip or an instrument clip. Each instrument clip is either a melodic instrument clip (synth, MIDI, CV) or a kit instrument clip. Each clip is assigned to a section.

#### Parameter
: The name of an adjustable value, such as LPF Frequency, Reverb Room Size, or OSC1 Level, that can be manipulated and saved as part of a clip and which influence the output generated by that clip. Parameters do not generate an output on their own. A trigger, such as the playback of a sample (in an audio clip) and a note event in an instrument clip, is required in order for parameters to impact the output of a clip. Some parameters can be modulated and automated. Format the name of the parameter like `LPF Frequency` and use the abbreviated name. Refer to the Parameter Abbreviations Table. 

#### Section
: In session mode, a section groups clips from separate tracks together so that they can be launched together. A clip can only belong to one section. Sections have settings that dictate the number of times a section should playback before stopping or moving to the next section. Each section has a distinct colour. In arranger mode, section colours to identify the different clip instances of a track.

#### Sample
: An audio file that can be played back as part of an audio clip or sequenced as part of an instrument clip.

#### Instrument Clip

Instrument clips enable you to sequence patterns by entering events in the sequencer. Without these events, an instrument clip does not generate an output.

##### Synth

: The Deluge synth engine allows sound design by configuration of subtractive or FM synthesis, or the playback and
manipulation of samples.

: Synth clips are typically used to create a melody for both lead and bass-style instruments.

: Notes are populated across the pad grid with the pitch affected by the up / down position on the grid rows.

: A colour is indicated for the notes on a synth clip and set by pitch. Colour can be edited.

###### Synth preset file

Saving a synth preset only saves the synth setting data. No patterns are stored with synth presets.

##### Kit

: Kits consist of unique sounds per row. Typically based on samples but also may be synthesized sounds, or MIDI or CV outputs.

: While the obvious and common use of kits is to trigger drum sounds such as a kick or snare, longer loops and non-percussive samples can also be used within kits.

: Kit sounds are mapped across rows of the sequencer - each individual sound is represented on its own row.

: Each row of the clip is coloured independently. Colour can be edited.

###### Kit preset file

Saving a kit preset only saves the kit setting data and sample links. No patterns are stored with kit presets.

##### Row
: A unique sequencer instance that is associated with a specific drum (for kit instrument clips) or note pitch (for melodic instrument clips). The instrument clip row contains information on the notes programmed into the sequencer. The instrument clip row also contains information on sequence length and the direction that the sequence should playback.

###### Note
: The name of an event that can be programmed in an instrument clip row in order to generate audio (for example, a synthesized sound or sample) or non-audio (for example, MIDI, CV, Gate) output. Each note has specific parameters that determine when and how a note is to be triggered (e.g. note position, note velocity, note probability, note iterance, note fill, note lift). 

###### Drum
: A unique instance of a kit instrument clip row that is associated with a sequence to generate an output. A drum is either an audio drum (synthesizer or sample) or non-audio drum (MIDI, Gate). 

### Output
: The information stored in a clip (samples, notes, parameters) generates an output. An output either generates audio (synthesizer sound or sample) or non-audio (MIDI, CV, Gate).

## Modes

Modes provide different ways of working with tracks and clips and contain the configuration settings for which tracks and clips are playing at any given time. They are mutually exclusive, meaning only one mode can be played at a time. Each mode is associated with a View which is the user interface for configuring the mode. 

Arranger Mode
: Allows you to arrange a song chronologically from beginning to end using Arranger View. Each track is represented by a single row on a timeline. The clips for a given track are placed in sequence from left to right.

Session Mode
: Allows you to work with tracks and clips using two main Session View layouts: Rows and Grid.
