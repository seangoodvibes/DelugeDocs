# Section

Song sections group together clips so that they can, for example, be controlled, launched, or armed together, making it easy to play arrangements and structure live sets. 

Sections can be structured into a chained sequence automatically playing each section. 

Sections are colour coded for clarity and controlled by the [SECTION] pad column in session mode.

A section is a Song playback mode concept.

A section may be comprised of one or more tracks. Within each track, each clip can belong to one section.

Sections enable you to launch a group of clips together and also to move between sections. 

The launch behaviour of a section can be configured to specify the number of times that section repeats before moving to the next section.
