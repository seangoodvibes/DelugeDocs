# Clip

Clips are unique instances of a track and include the additional building blocks (e.g. sequences, samples, modulation) required to generate an output (e.g. sound, midi, cv).

Based on the track type, the clip will either be an Audio Clip or an Instrument Clip.

A single clip instance can only be assigned to one track. A track may have many clip instances assigned to it (this allows you to create variations of a track).

## Audio Clip

An Audio Clip belongs to an Audio Track.

## Instrument Clip

An Instrument Clip can belong to a Synth Track, Kit Track, MIDI Track, or CV track.
