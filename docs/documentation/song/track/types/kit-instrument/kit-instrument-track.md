# Kit track

Kits consist of unique sounds per row. Typically based on samples but also may be synthesized sounds, or MIDI or CV outputs.

While the obvious and common use of kits is to trigger drum sounds such as a kick or snare, longer loops and non-percussive samples can also be used within kits.

Kit sounds are mapped across rows of the sequencer - each individual sound is represented on its own row.

Each row of the kit is coloured independently. Colour can be edited.

Saving a kit preset only saves the kit setting data and sample links. No patterns are stored with kit presets.
