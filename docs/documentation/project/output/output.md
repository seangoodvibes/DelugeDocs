# Output

An output is a type of instrument and is comprised of one or more clips (exception Arranger View? you can create a output without any clips added yet..)

An Instrument is the “Output” of a Clip - the thing which turns the sequence or notes into sound (or MIDI or CV output). Instruments include Kit, MIDIInstrument, and CVInsttrument. And then there’s SoundInstrument, which is basically a synth.
