# Section

A section is a Song playback mode concept.

A section may be comprised of one or more outputs. Within each output, each clip can belong to one section.

Sections enable you to launch a group of clips together and also to move between sections. 

The launch behaviour of a section can be configured to specify the number of times that section repeats before moving to the next section.
