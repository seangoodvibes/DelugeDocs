# Melodic instrument track

Notes are populated across the pad grid with the pitch affected by the up / down position on the grid rows.

Pitch is represented by the rows of the grid. Lower rows are the lower notes and increases in pitch as the rows increase.

A colour is indicated for the notes on a melodic instrument track and set by pitch. Colour can be edited.

Saving a melodic instrument track preset only saves the melodic instrument track setting data. No patterns are stored with presets.
