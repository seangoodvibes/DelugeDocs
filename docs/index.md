# Deluge Community Firmware

Synthstrom Audible released the [**source code**](https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/wiki/How%E2%80%90To-Guides) of the Deluge firmware and started a Github community project inviting everyone to participate in improving and extending the Deluge user experience.

To that end, this website was developed so that up-to-date documentation for the Deluge Community Firmware could be maintained. Everyone is welcome to participate in improving and extending this documentation.
