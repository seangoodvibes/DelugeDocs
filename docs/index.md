# Welcome

## Community firmware

Synthstrom Audible [released the source code](https://synthstrom.com/open/) of the Deluge firmware and started a [Github community project](https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware) inviting everyone to participate in improving and extending the Deluge user experience.

To that end, this website was developed so that up-to-date documentation for the Deluge Community Firmware could be maintained. Everyone is welcome to participate in improving and extending this documentation.

## Contributing to the documentation

You're welcome to contribute to this documentation whether you're a Deluge Community Firmware contributor or just an enthusiastic Deluge user. To get started, see [Contributing to the documentation](contributing/contributing-to-the-docs.md)
