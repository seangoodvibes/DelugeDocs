# About this site

This is a static site built using the `MkDocs` platform with the theme `Material for MkDocs`, which expands upon MkDocs functionality to allow for even more robust and customizable documentation website building.

## Documentation

#### Markdown

Documentation is written in Markdown and is converted into HTML automatically by the MkDocs build tool. For help with Markdown, see the [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) on GitHub.

#### Editing

Each page in the documentation has an **Edit** button at the top. This brings you to the source file in GitHub which allows you to make and preview your changes, then commit your changes to the repo.

#### Navigation

The navigation for the website (e.g. the tabs at the top, the order and hierarchy of pages in the navigation sidebar) is configured in [mkdocs.yml](mkdocs.yml)

## Rebuilding the Website

After commits are made to this repo, a GitHub action will run that will re-build the website. Once this is done, the website will refresh with the changes.
