## Documentation

#### Markdown

Documentation is written in Markdown and is converted into HTML automatically by the MkDocs build tool. For help with Markdown, see the [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) on GitHub.

#### Navigation

The navigation for the website (e.g. the tabs at the top, the order and hierarchy of pages in the navigation sidebar) is configured in [mkdocs.yml](mkdocs.yml).

## Rebuilding the Website

After commits are made to this repo, a GitHub action runs that re-builds the website. Once this is done, the website will refresh with the changes.
