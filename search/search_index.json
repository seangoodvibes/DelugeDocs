This may begin to affect CPU performance if you have more than 50 to 100 sounds loaded. For this reason, you may wish to refrain from importing large folders of samples as kits where these are not in-fact used.

The Deluge is straightforward to use at a basic level, but also offers incredibly deep features, making it a favourite for both beginner and experienced musicians. With a built-in rechargeable battery, the Deluge is a powerful portable studio.</p> <p>The Deluge includes an onboard synthesizer engine and a sampler. This means you can create sounds from scratch or sample and manipulate audio. You can layer parts and experiment with textures ranging from punchy drums to atmospheric pads.</p> <p>Its sequencer is flexible, letting you create complex song arrangements or dynamic jam sessions using the internal synth engine or external gear. You can experiment with Euclidian sequences, conditional note triggers, polyrhythms, and unusual time signatures. The Deluge lets you launch patterns groups, mute sections, and adjust parameters on the fly, so it\u2019s great for live performances.</p> <p>The optional community-driven firmware dramatically expands the Deluge\u2019s capabilities with additional synthesis modes, powerful new views and control schemes. Whether you\u2019re focused on recording, sound design, or performance, the Deluge provides a unique approach to music-making that can grow with you over time.</p>"},{"location":"documentation/introduction/introduction-to-the-deluge/#sketching-song-ideas","title":"Sketching song ideas","text":"<p>The Deluge is ideal for quickly sketching song ideas.
